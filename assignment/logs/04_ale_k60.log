Usage: ALE [-options] alignments.[s|b]am assembly.fasta[.gz] ALEoutput.txt

Options: <i>nt <f>loat <s>tring [default]
-h or --help    : print out this help
--kmer <f>      : Kmer depth for kmer stats [4]
--qOff <i>      : Quality ascii offset (illumina) [33] or 64 (or 0)
--pl <s>        : placementOutputBAM
--pm <s>        : library parameter file (auto outputs .param)
--nout          : only output meta information (no per base) [off]

--metagenome    : Evaluate each contig independently for depth & kmer metrics
--realign[=matchScore,misMatchPenalty,gapOpenPenalty,gapExtPenalty,minimumSoftClip (default: 1,3,11,4,8) ]
                   Realign reads with Striped-Smith-Waterman honoring ambiguous reference bases
                   and stacking homo-polymer indels
                   for PacBio, try --realign=1,5,2,1,20 (similar to BWA-SW recommendations)

--minQual <i>   : Minimum quality score to use in Z-normalization (default 3).
                   Illumina quality scores can be unreliable below this threshold
